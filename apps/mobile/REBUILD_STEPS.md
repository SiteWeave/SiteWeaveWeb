# Steps to Rebuild and Submit

The build failed because the provisioning profile needs to be updated to include the "Sign in with Apple" capability.

## Option 1: Quick Fix - Let EAS Regenerate Automatically

Run this command and answer the prompts:

```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

When prompted:
1. **"Do you want to log in to your Apple account?"** → Answer **Yes** (Y)
2. Enter your Apple ID: `djpugst3r@gmail.com`
3. Enter your password
4. EAS will automatically detect the new capability and regenerate the provisioning profile
5. The build will proceed automatically

## Option 2: Manual Credentials Update

If you prefer to manually update credentials first:

```bash
eas credentials
```

1. Select **iOS**
2. Select **production** profile
3. Choose **"Build Credentials: Manage everything needed to build your project"**
4. Select **"Provisioning Profile"**
5. Choose **"Remove Provisioning Profile"** or **"Regenerate Provisioning Profile"**
6. EAS will regenerate it with the new Sign in with Apple capability
7. Then run: `eas build --platform ios --profile production`

## After Build Completes

Once the build finishes successfully, run:

```bash
eas submit --platform ios --profile production --id [BUILD_ID_FROM_OUTPUT]
```

Or I can do this automatically once the build succeeds!

## What Changed

✅ Added Sign in with Apple (required by Apple for apps with social login)
✅ Updated app icon to your SiteWeave logo
✅ Kept iPhone-only configuration
✅ Build number incremented to 14

All code is ready - just need to regenerate the provisioning profile!
