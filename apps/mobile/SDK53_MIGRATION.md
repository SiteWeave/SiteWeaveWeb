# Migration to Expo SDK 53

## What Changed

### Package Versions Updated
- **Expo SDK**: `~51.0.0` → `~53.0.0`
- **Expo Router**: `~3.5.0` → `~4.0.9`
- **React**: `18.2.0` → `18.3.1`
- **React Native**: `0.74.5` → `0.76.5`
- **New Architecture**: **DISABLED** (set to `false`)

### Key Changes in SDK 53
1. More stable than SDK 54
2. Better compatibility with existing packages
3. Less strict type checking (New Arch disabled)
4. Compatible with Expo Go

## Migration Steps

### 1. Clean Install
```bash
cd apps/mobile

# Remove old dependencies
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json

# Install SDK 53 packages
npm install

# Clear all caches
npx expo start --clear
```

### 2. iOS (if applicable)
```bash
# Clear iOS build cache
cd ios
rm -rf Pods Podfile.lock
pod install --repo-update
cd ..
```

### 3. Android (if applicable)
```bash
# Clear Android build cache
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
```

## Breaking Changes to Watch For

### Expo Router 4.x Changes
SDK 53 uses Expo Router 4.x which has some differences from 3.x:

1. **Screen Options** - More consistent API
2. **Navigation** - Some navigation methods may have changed
3. **Typing** - Better TypeScript support

Your current code should work fine, but if you see router-related errors, check:
- Navigation hooks usage
- Screen option configurations
- Route parameters

### React Native 0.76.x
- Minor prop type improvements
- Better performance
- Some deprecated APIs removed

## What We Kept

✅ **All the boolean fixes we made** - These are still best practices:
- Explicit boolean props: `multiline={true}`
- Boolean casting: `disabled={!!loading}`
- These prevent future issues and improve code quality

✅ **Explicit screen options** - Better for clarity and maintenance

## Testing Checklist

After migration, test:
- [ ] App launches without errors
- [ ] All tabs navigate correctly
- [ ] Login/Authentication works
- [ ] Camera and image picker work
- [ ] Messages load and send
- [ ] Tasks/Issues display correctly
- [ ] Calendar events show properly
- [ ] No HostFunction errors in console

## Rollback Plan

If SDK 53 has issues, you can rollback to SDK 51:

```bash
# In package.json, change back to:
"expo": "~51.0.0",
"expo-router": "~3.5.0",
"react": "18.2.0",
"react-native": "0.74.5"
# ... (other SDK 51 versions)

# Then:
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npx expo start --clear
```

## Why SDK 53 Instead of 54?

- **SDK 54**: Latest but has stricter requirements, New Arch always on in Expo Go
- **SDK 53**: Stable, well-tested, optional New Arch, great Expo Go support
- **SDK 51**: Your previous version, but SDK 53 has important bug fixes

## Expected Improvements

With SDK 53 and New Arch disabled:
✅ No more HostFunction boolean errors (relaxed type checking)
✅ Better Expo Go compatibility
✅ More stable development experience
✅ Faster builds
✅ Better package compatibility

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Module not found" errors
```bash
npx expo start --clear
# Or
rm -rf node_modules && npm install
```

### Issue: "Incompatible version" warnings
```bash
npx expo install --fix
```

### Issue: iOS build fails
```bash
cd ios && pod deintegrate && pod install && cd ..
```

### Issue: Android build fails
```bash
cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..
npx expo start --clear
```

## Additional Notes

- **Expo Go**: Will work great with SDK 53
- **Development Build**: Not required, but still an option
- **EAS Build**: Fully compatible with SDK 53
- **OTA Updates**: Will work as expected

## Next Steps

1. Run the clean install commands
2. Test the app thoroughly
3. If issues arise, check this guide
4. Consider creating a development build for production
