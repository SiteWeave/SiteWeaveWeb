-- Create a new policy that allows:
-- 1. Any authenticated user to create contacts (original simple policy - needed for invitation acceptance)
-- 2. This is safe because contacts are scoped by organization_id and created_by_user_id
-- Note: The original policy was very permissive (just auth.uid() IS NOT NULL)
-- We keep it simple to avoid recursion and timing issues during invitation acceptance
